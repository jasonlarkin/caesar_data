Revenue vs. Emissions: Bittensor’s primary mechanism for rewarding participants is through the daily emission of 7,200 TAO tokens, which will be halved in late 20257,200 Bittensor $TAO tokens get emitted to the network every day until the first halving in September 2025. That’s $4 million per day, $120 million per month and $1.5 billion annually. Here’s the AI teams competing to build the best services on Bittensor. No single team is larger than a dozen people full-time. Most of them are just 2-3 people. A whopping THIRD of these teams are earning millions of dollars every month… and the bar is still low given the nascency of Bittensor. Jump in. You’re welcome. ��

2030 Market Capitalization Projection
To translate the 2030 revenue forecast into a market capitalization projection, valuation multiples from comparable high-growth technology sectors are applied. AI and crypto-related sectors command premium multiples due to their high growth potential and transformative natureM&A in AI: 2025 Valuation Multiples and Key Trends

Relevant Valuation Multiples (2023-2025):
AI M&A: An analysis of over 90 AI M&A deals showed an average enterprise value-to-revenue (EV/Revenue) multiple of 25.8xM&A in AI: 2025 Valuation Multiples and Key Trends

Applying a conservative range of these multiples to VanEck's base case revenue forecast of $10.17 billion yields the following market capitalization projection for the decentralized AI sector in 2030:

Conservative Projection (5x-10x Multiple): $50.85 Billion - $101.7 Billion
This range reflects multiples seen in the broader private crypto and public software sectors.
Base Case Projection (15x-25x Multiple): $152.55 Billion - $254.25 Billion
This range aligns more closely with the high-growth expectations and observed M&A multiples for specialized AI companies.
Aggressive Projection (30x+ Multiple): >$305.1 Billion
This reflects the highest-end valuation multiples reserved for transformative technologies like LLM vendors and could be achieved if decentralized AI captures significant market share from centralized incumbents and demonstrates a clear path to profitability.
