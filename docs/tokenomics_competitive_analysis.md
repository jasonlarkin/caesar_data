2. **Community Governance**: Token holders participate in platform development
3. **Brand Sentiment**: Token price reflects community confidence
4. **Sustainable Growth**: Economic incentives drive faster innovation

#### **Critical Reality Check**

**1. Economic Alignment - Questionable Value**
- **Reality**: Most AI agent platforms have strong open-source communities without tokens
- **Evidence**: CrewAI (35K stars), AgentGPT (34K stars) - massive communities without tokenomics
- **Question**: Do economic incentives actually create better contributors than intrinsic motivation?

**2. Community Governance - Limited Impact**
- **Reality**: Token holders rarely have meaningful governance input in most projects
- **Evidence**: Most DAOs and tokenized projects have low voter participation
- **Question**: Is "community governance" just marketing speak for token distribution?

**3. Brand Sentiment - Volatile and Unreliable**
- **Reality**: Token prices are driven by speculation, not platform performance
- **Evidence**: Crypto markets are highly volatile and sentiment-driven
- **Question**: Can token price accurately reflect platform quality and user satisfaction?

**4. Sustainable Growth - Unproven in AI**
- **Reality**: No major AI platform has succeeded primarily through tokenomics
- **Evidence**: Leading AI platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) use traditional funding
- **Question**: Is tokenomics a solution looking for a problem in AI development?
