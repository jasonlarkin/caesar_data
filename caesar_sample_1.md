An analysis of leading US-listed carbon capture technology players reveals distinct economic profiles dictated by their underlying technology, business models, and eligibility for government incentives. NET Power Inc. and ExxonMobil demonstrate the strongest potential unit economics, primarily due to their ability to leverage substantial US federal tax credits for clean hydrogen (Section 45V) and carbon capture (Section 45Q) that can significantly outweigh production costs. Aker Carbon Capture exhibits the lowest direct capital and operating costs for point-source capture, positioning it as a highly efficient technology provider. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum's direct air capture (DAC) strategy, while technologically significant for carbon removal, currently faces the highest costs, making its economic viability heavily dependent on premium-priced carbon credits and subsidies. LanzaTech Global's value-add model, which converts waste carbon into high-value fuels, shows strong potential contingent on commodity prices and stacked environmental credits.

Comparative Analysis of Capex Intensity
Capital expenditure (capex) intensity, measured as the total capital cost per ton of annual CO2 capture or utilization capacity, is a critical metric for assessing the scalability and economic feasibility of each technology. DAC and oxy-combustion technologies currently exhibit the highest capex intensity, while post-combustion and ATR systems for point-source capture are significantly less capital-intensive.

Conclusion on Unit Economics
NET Power and ExxonMobil exhibit the strongest potential unit economics due to their direct alignment with the most lucrative federal incentives.

NET Power's model is exceptionally leveraged. At its planned capture rate of ~2.87 tons of CO2 per MWh, the $85/ton 45Q credit provides a potential revenue stream of over $240 per MWhNET Power’s First Allam Cycle 300-MW Gas-Fired ... - POWER …

. This is significantly higher than projected blue hydrogen production costs of $1.10-$1.50 per kgCosts of blue hydrogen? - Thunder Said Energy
. This incentive structure effectively de-risks the multi-billion dollar investment and establishes a profitable foundation for its broader business of selling hydrogen, ammonia, and CO2 storage services.
Aker Carbon Capture possesses the strongest unit economics from a pure cost perspective. Its mature post-combustion technology has the lowest demonstrated capex and opex among the group, making it an economically efficient solution for industrial clients who need to decarbonize existing facilities. Its profitability, however, is dependent on the commercial terms of its service contracts rather than direct commodity or credit sales.

LanzaTech Global has a unique and potentially robust economic model based on upgrading low-value waste into high-value products. The economics are favorable when there is a significant price spread between its outputs (like SAF, priced at over $6 per gallon) and its inputs (waste gas), amplified by stacked credits (45Q, 45Z, LCFS)U.S. sustainable aviation fuel production target faces cost, ...
. This makes its model highly sensitive to volatile commodity markets but offers substantial upside.

Occidental Petroleum currently faces the most challenging unit economics. The extremely high capital and operating costs of DAC mean that its profitability relies entirely on the combination of the $180/ton 45Q credit and the willingness of corporate customers to pay a significant premium (over $400/ton) for permanent carbon removal creditsBlackRock invests $550 million in Occidental carbon …
. While it leads in the technologically crucial field of carbon dioxide removal, its current cost structure makes it less economically competitive than point-source capture technologies.
