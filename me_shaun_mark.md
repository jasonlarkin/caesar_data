@jasonlarkin caeser is boasting highest HLE score in the world right now supposedly - https://x.com/caesar_data/status/1956385408834470088
Caesar (@caesar_data)
At 55.87%, Caesar’s HLE score is the highest published score in the world.

We benchmarked Humanity’s Last Exam against various levels of compute; 1CU, 2CU, 3CU, and 10CU. Currently, in Alpha, Caesar is running at 4CU.

We welcome third party evaluations using Caesar and will

Get the other benchmarks, could have just focused on scoring well on HLE…

They've shared many others along the way, they weren't optimizing for any single one. 

Mark has started giving access to a few folks who were skeptical: https://x.com/zephyr_z9/status/1956749285447315807

Still waiting on independent verification of the benchmark of course. If you wanted to comment on the main post and ask for API access to eval I bet they'd offer it.

This turned out to be a great product.
They use Gemini/R1/K2/Maverick as the base, and their system works on top of it
Performance improvement is coming from better data retrieval and focusing extensively on source verification.

Yea it all seems reasonable, if any other team of O(5-10) wanted to work for 6 months could do similarly 

Every week a new OSS model is out beating the previous. I’ll try get better summary

One angle is the cursor windsurf Claude code etc, with those you can do the data retrieval, source verification, and general tool integration. Actually would be fun to run the evals on any of these systems, prob a representative system out there on evals that show the perf 

For individual devs don’t see the val prop, for enterprises and everyone else behind the curve makes sense
